# attested-fetch

An experimental tool for fetching content from an HTTPS URL within an SGX enclave.
The output is a JSON file containing SGX evidence and the HTTPS response.

## Getting started

```sh
./build.sh
./test.sh
```

Run manually:
```sh
dist/afetch dist/libafetch.enclave.so out.json https://github.com nonce42
```

## Virtual mode

In addition to the normal mode of usage described above, attested fetch may be
used in a "virtual mode". In this mode, no SGX enclave is used. This can be
useful for development, but provides no verifiable security guarantees about
its output.

Virtual mode can be enabled by setting the `PLATFORM` variable:
```sh
export PLATFORM=virtual
./build.sh
./test.sh
```
